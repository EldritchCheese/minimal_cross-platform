Minimal Cross-Platform Example
==============================

This is intended as a minimal working example of cross-platform compilation
  from Linux to Windows.
Currently, it shows an example of static linking,
  but it shouldn't be hard to add cross-platform shared libraries.

Edit: This example is no longer is use.  A more complete build system
      using make is at [magic_cpp_makefile](http://github.com/Lunderberg/magic_cpp_makefile).
